# CROWDAO_truffle
DAO with Truffle Framework and Front end with React Js

System Requirements :
Node-Js >= 12.0

Check the Ganache Network-ID and Map it correctly in truffle-config.js

In Ganache, If you want to use old workspace go to settings and add this 'truffle-config.js' in truffle projects.
			Else you can config the new workspace by adding 'truffle-config.js' in truffle projects.
			
Make sure you have a browser with Metamask extension and then connect the metamask with your Ganache.

For Execution :

1) Go to Client folder and you dont find node_modules in it.
	So you have to perform "npm install"

2) Head back to crowdao folder and execute command "sh ./run.sh"

3) If error occurs while executing run.sh at 'yarn' statement. 
	Again go to Client folder , run "npm start"

4) You have a browser instance is launched and code is running on Localhost:3000
